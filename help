This is a script to update the to-do list in various ways. It is run only
with flags and user inputs. The general form is as follows:

  python modify.py [-flags] <card#> [args]

The available flags are the following:

  -b <card#>
    Blocks card <card#>.

  -c <card#> <type>
    Creates a card with the number <card#> of type <type>. Also sets up the
    link to Kanbanize, a template notes card that tells you to make a real
    one, and an invalid PR link.

  -d <card#>
    Deletes the link to the notes for card <card#> if the link is to the
    template file. You probably don't want to use this because it makes it
    more work to add notes to the card, and it's bundled with -r anyway.

  -n <card#>
    Adds a file for the notes for a card, and links to it on the entry for
    that card on the "In Progess" page.

  -p <card#> <pr#>
    Changes the PR link to a valid one (assuming you haven't already done
    this) by adding the PR number to the link.

  -q <card#>
    Moves a card to QA.

  -r <card#>
    Archives a card by removing it from the "In Progress" page and adding it
    to the corresponding archive page. Also updates the links for the card
    and its colour on the card list. If there is a notes page, the link is
    updated, and if not the dead link is deleted from the card on the archive
    page.

  -t 
    Can be combined with any flag to test it. All the changed files are link
    on the test output page, which can be accessed from the card list page.

  -u 
    Used to update the file config to rearrange the structure of the files in
    the archive. To do the update, put the new config files in the update
    directory and run this script. The config will be updated (assuming the
    test flag is not set). If updating the partitioning of the cards, the
    old files will be written to the directory "archiveOld" before they are
    overwritten to avoid the loss of data. If you want you can delete that
    directory after the script is run.

At the moment, flags cannot be combined (except for the testing flag).
